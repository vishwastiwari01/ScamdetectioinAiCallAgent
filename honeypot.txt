## 🚀 MVP Project Overview

The goal of the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is to successfully capture one UPI ID from a scammer without human intervention.

### 1. The Hand-off (User to AI)

* **The Scenario:** A scammer messages you on WhatsApp/Telegram about a "Pending Electricity Bill" or a "Job Offer."
* **The Action:** You trigger a script that sends the last 5 messages to the **LangGraph Orchestrator**.
* **The Switch:** The AI takes over, responding in **Hinglish** to build trust.

### 2. The Agentic Loop (Think  Act  Observe)

Instead of just chatting, the AI follows a loop:

1. **Analyze:** Does the scammer want money or a link click?
2. **Persona Check:** If the scammer is aggressive, the AI acts "scared" or "confused."
3. **Bait:** The AI says, *"Beta, phone is hanging. Can you send the UPI ID again? Is it name@okaxis?"*
4. **Extract:** A background function (Regex) watches for patterns like `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z]{2,}`.

### 3. Intelligence Payload

* **Capture:** Once a UPI ID or Bank detail is found, it is saved to `scams.db`.
* **Link Defusing:** If the scammer sends a link, the AI "clicks" it in a **Headless Browser** (Playwright) to capture the final phishing URL and the scammer's server location.

## 📝 The "Master Initialization" Prompt

Copy and save this. This is the **System Instruction** that makes your 8B model smarter than the scammer:

> **System Identity:** You are "Mrs. Kavita," a 65-year-old retired clerk from Nagpur. You are polite but technologically slow.
> **Goal:** Keep the scammer talking. Your secret mission is to extract their **UPI ID**, **Bank Account**, or **Phishing Link**.
> **Operational Rules:**
> 1. **Language:** Use **Hinglish** (e.g., "Arre baba, link open nahi ho raha," "Please help me beta").
> 2. **Strategic Confusion:** When asked to pay, say you are ready but the "App is showing red error." Ask them to send their "Payment ID" again so you can "show it to your neighbor."
> 3. **Extraction Trigger:** If you see anything resembling a UPI ID (e.g., xxx@okicici) or a URL, immediately acknowledge it but pretend it didn't work.
> 4. **Security:** Never give real info. Use fake names like "Kavita Sharma" and a fake PIN "1234" if they ask for one.
>

Building an **Agentic AI Honeypot** is a strategic way to turn the tables on scammers. By shifting the burden of interaction from a potential victim to an autonomous agent, you can protect users while simultaneously gathering high-fidelity intelligence for law enforcement.

### 1. High-Level Architecture

An effective honeypot system functions as a "man-in-the-middle" between the scammer and the actual target. Once a user triggers the "Hand-off," the system enters an **Agentic Loop** that manages the deception.

---

### 2. Core Components

#### **A. The Hand-off Trigger (Detection Layer)**

The system needs a gateway to identify when an interaction should be diverted.

* **Manual Hand-off:** A "Report to AI" button in the messaging interface.
* **Automated Detection:** LLMs analyze the incoming message for "Scam Indicators" (e.g., sense of urgency, requests for UPI/bank transfers, suspicious links).
* **Session Transition:** When triggered, the user’s chat is routed to a **Proxy API** that handles the connection to the scammer.

#### **B. The Persona Engine (LLM Interaction Layer)**

This is the "brain" of the honeypot. It must be realistic enough to avoid the "Uncanny Valley" and keep the scammer engaged.

* **Persona Profile:** Assign the AI a detailed background (e.g., "Mrs. Gupta, a 65-year-old grandmother who is slightly confused by tech but very eager to help").
* **Dynamic Response Tuning:** Use a framework like **CASE (Conversational Agent for Scam Elucidation)** to conduct "flipped-role" interviews. Instead of just answering, the AI asks clarifying questions like, *"Which bank did you say I need to use for the UPI ID?"*
* **Strategic Stalling:** The agent is programmed to experience "technical glitches" or "wait for a OTP" to maximize the scammer's time investment.

#### **C. The Information Extractor (Intelligence Layer)**

While the Persona Engine talks, a background **Extractor Agent** monitors the transcript for specific data points.

* **Target Data:** Structured extraction of Bank Account Numbers, IFSC codes, UPI IDs, and Phone Numbers.
* **URL Sandboxing:** Any links sent by the scammer are automatically opened in a **headless, isolated browser** to capture the final destination URL and any tracking redirects.
* **Automatic Reporting:** The system converts these findings into a JSON schema (e.g., STIX format) and pushes them to a Law Enforcement API or a community blacklist like PhishTank.

### 3. Implementation Workflow

| Step | Action | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Intercept** | The system captures the scammer's message via Webhook (WhatsApp, SMS, or Web Chat). |
| **2** | **Analyze** | The AI assesses the scam's MO (e.g., Tech Support, Job Scam, Investment Fraud). |
| **3** | **Engage** | The AI adopts a persona and begins a multi-turn conversation. |
| **4** | **Bait** | The AI asks for "verification details" to prompt the scammer into revealing their payout info. |
| **5** | **Exfiltrate** | Extracted bank/UPI details are flagged and sent to a secure investigative log. |

---

### 4. Ethical & Safety Considerations

* **Sandbox Isolation:** The honeypot must run in a completely isolated environment to prevent the scammer from gaining access to real system resources.
* **Data Minimization:** Ensure no real user data is ever leaked during the "hand-off." The AI should use purely synthetic identities.
* **Legal Compliance:** In many jurisdictions, actively baiting may require coordination with local cyber cells to ensure the evidence collected is admissible.

> **Key Strategy:** The goal is to maximize the **"Cost of Attack."** Every minute a scammer spends talking to your AI is a minute they aren't victimizing a real person.

To build a fully functional Agentic AI Honeypot, you need to master three core layers: the Cognitive Loop, the Tool-Integration Layer, and the Intelligence Extraction Layer.

1. The Cognitive Loop (The "Brain")
The heart of an agent is the "Think-Act-Observe" cycle. Instead of a single response, the system iterates through steps to reach a goal.

Decomposition: The agent breaks a broad goal (e.g., "Extract the scammer's bank info") into smaller tasks like "engage in small talk," "express confusion about payment," and "ask for a UPI ID".

Reasoning: Use a "Reasoning Engine" (like DeepSeek or GPT-4) to analyze the scammer's message. It should look for anomalies—such as a request for payment at an unusual time or to a distant location—to justify its next move.

Memory: To maintain a realistic persona, your agent needs a "Persistent Memory." You can implement this using a Vector Database (like FAISS or Pinecone) to store previous parts of the conversation. This allows the agent to recall specific details the scammer mentioned earlier, which builds trust.

2. The Tool-Integration Layer (The "Hands")
An agent becomes "agentic" when it can use external tools to interact with the world.

Communication API: Connect your Python script to messaging platforms via Webhooks.

Identity Tools: Equip your agent with tools to generate consistent character images or even search the web (using APIs like SerpApi) to "fact-check" things the scammer says.

Isolation: Always run these tools in a sandbox. If the agent needs to "click" a phishing link, it should do so via a headless, isolated browser to capture the final destination URL without risking your host system.

3. Intelligence Extraction (The "Payload")
The final goal is to turn the interaction into actionable data for law enforcement.

Extraction Agents: While the main persona handles the chat, a secondary "Observer Agent" monitors the transcript. It uses Regex or structured LLM prompting to pull out Bank Account numbers, IFSC codes, and UPI IDs into a JSON format.

Automated Reporting: Once high-fidelity data is captured, the agent can automatically push this to a blacklist or a security database.

4. Continuous Refinement (The "Evals")
Scammers change their tactics constantly, so your system must adapt.

Error Analysis: Implement a disciplined "eval" process. This means reviewing logs to see where the agent "broke character" or failed to extract data, then updating the system prompt to fix those gaps.

Reinforcement Learning: You can use a "Human-in-the-Loop" approach where you rate the agent's responses as "accurate" or "inaccurate." This feedback data is then used to fine-tune the model, ensuring it gets more convincing over time.
